This app allows a user to sign up and upload photos that a ML algorithm will be run on to select the faces in the picture. Think Facebook's tagging feature. I built this fullstack app to gain experience working on a fullstack app with React, Node && Express, and to further gain experience with fetching RESTful APIs.
